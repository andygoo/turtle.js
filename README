-= What is this =-

What? Can't you tell? This is turtle.js. The combination of Turtles and
JavaScript.

-= Features =-
Features are as follows:
* Turtles
* JavaScript
Oh I guess it uses Canvas and HTML5 as well but that isn't important.

-= How to use =-
Make a new turtle like this:
  var turtle = new Turtle();
Your turtle can walk ANYWHERE (well not anywhere...)
  turtle.walk(50); // Walk 50 pixels
  turtle.turn(90); // Turn 90 degrees
  turtle.jump(10, 150); // Jump to position x = 10, y = 150
You can even have an actual turtle on the screen!
  turtle.draw(); // TURTLES
